# **Coach Claude: Product Specification Document**

## **Problem to Solve**

Executive coaches spend lots of their time on administrative tasks rather than actual coaching. They struggle with:

* **Manual session preparation**: Reviewing scattered notes and trying to remember client context before each session  
* **Inefficient post-session workflows**: Spending hours writing follow-up emails and action items after sessions  
* **Fragmented client data**: Client information spread across multiple tools (calendars, notes, emails, resources)  
* **Lost coaching insights**: Valuable patterns and progress tracking getting buried in unstructured session notes  
* **Resource management chaos**: Coaching frameworks and resources scattered with no client-specific organization

Executive coaches charge $200-500+ per hour. If this saves even 2 hours/week, that's $400-1000+ in time value. If we price this tool at $197/month, where the tool saves a coach even 1 hour per week, it pays for itself 2-5x over for most executive coaches.

## **Solution**

Coach Claude transforms raw coaching conversations into actionable insights, helping executive coaches track progress, prepare smarter, and deliver follow-ups in minutes rather than hours. The platform:

* **Intelligently prepares sessions** by analyzing client history and generating contextual preparation notes  
* **Transforms raw transcripts** into structured insights, action items, and follow-up communications  
* **Maintains dynamic client profiles** that evolve automatically from session data  
* **Organizes resources intelligently** with client-specific tagging and recommendations  
* **Integrates seamlessly** with Google Calendar for session management

## **User Journey**

### **Pre-Session Workflow**

1. Coach opens Coach Claude, which syncs with Google Calendar to show upcoming coaching sessions  
2. Coach clicks "Prepare Session" for an upcoming client meeting  
3. System analyzes client history and previous sessions to generate preparation insights  
4. Coach can paste additional preparation prompts or specific focus areas

### **Post-Session Workflow**

1. Coach pastes session notes/transcript into Coach Claude  
2. System processes transcript using customizable AI prompts to generate:  
   * Session summary and key insights  
   * Action items and commitments  
   * Follow-up email drafts  
   * AI-recommended resources for the coach  
3. AI analyzes session content and researches relevant resources (articles, frameworks, tools)

5. Client profile automatically updates with new context and insights  
6. Coach is able to use AI to chat and engage with all the client notes \- both on a per client basis and across all clients.
